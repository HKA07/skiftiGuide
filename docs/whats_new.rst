V.0.2.0 (9 June 2025)
  •	Now supports any kind of TBSS-processed input, as long as the require files         (skeletonized FA, mask, etc) are provided.
  •	Along with that, an additional flag --writemaskcoordinates has been added to the     docker which generates a text file that contains coordinates of voxels in x,y,z      ASCII format, in the same order as they appear in the skifti file.
