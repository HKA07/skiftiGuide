**V.0.2.0 (9 June 2025)**
  •	Now supports any kind of TBSS-processed input, as long as the required files         (skeletonized FA, mask, etc) are provided.
  •	Along with that, an additional flag ``--writemaskcoordinates`` has been added to the ``Docker`` which generates a text file that contains coordinates of voxels in       x,y,z ASCII format, in the same order as they appear in the Skifti file.

**V.0.1.1 (May 2025)**
  • Requires TBSS data processed specifically using ANTs-TBSS and expected     precomputed ROI CSVs.
